It is the first time we rented a vacation home on a camping ground. We had
doubts about its quietness. To our great surprise it is dead quiet at night and
during the day, we hardly felt there were other people around. They keep the
traffic away from in and around the residences. Its amenities are great. Bike
rentals, tennis courts, theater, swimming pool, snack bar, restaurant, laundry
facilities, supermarket, cash withdrawal machine and from what I saw, many
activities for the young. The beach was a 3-minute walk from our house. The
house itself was very clean. It sleeps seven people with two bathrooms and
sauna. Negative comments: the terrace needs to be swept and internet connection
is terrible. Even though WIFI signal was strong, there was insufficient
bandwidth.
