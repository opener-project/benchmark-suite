This was the first time we went to Hotel The Sleepy Sloth. Upon arrival we were
greeted by the manager Grace Hopper. She guided us to our room and even carried
our heavy suitcases with one hand. Simply amazing, especially for her age!

On our way to the swimming pool we bumped into other guests such as Charles
Babbage, Robert Downey, Jr and even Barack Obama himself. Sadly the swimming
pool was not as great as we hoped for. It was very cold and the water looked
dirty.

Next to the hotel is an office of the United Nations. This looks a bit out of
place and might make you feel uncomfortable. There's also a little postal
office nearby run by Jean-Claude Van Damme. The postal office looks really
cute.
